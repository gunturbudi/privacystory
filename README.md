# PrivacyStory: Tool Support for Extracting Privacy Requirements from User Stories

Privacy by design requires that developers address privacy concerns from the early stage of software development life cycle. It encourages them to take a proactive approach to privacy engineering by identifying personal data, creating conceptual data flow diagrams, and identifying privacy threats. We argue that by providing a tool that automates some of the steps can reduce the burden on development teams. We develop a tool called PrivacyStory, including an end-to-end privacy requirement generation from a set of user stories. The tool provides some automation, utilizing a current state-of-the art natural language processing model. The core aim of our tool is to assist development teams in becoming more agile in their approach to privacy requirements engineering.
